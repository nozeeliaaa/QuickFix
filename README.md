# QuickFix

Why QuickFix?
In today's world, home repairs are often time-consuming, stressful and unpredictable. Finding a reliable technician for plumbing, electrical, or appliance repairs can be frustrating, with long wait times and unpredicted costs.

This inspired the creation of QuickFix which will solve the problem by providing a smart, on-demand home repair platform that connects users with verified technicians in real-time. The app will allow instant booking, real-time tracking and transparent pricing - making home maintenance seamless and hassle-free.

Additionally, as there are a shortage of jobs in Jamaica this will provide a platform for unemployed individuals to gain employment. We chose this project as it tackles a real-world challenge while utilizing various programming languages such as Java, Kafka and AWS to ensure a fast, reliable and scalable solution.
